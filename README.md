#### Make Binary trees easy for everyone

* You can create a binary tree from a list and convert that binary tree into the list
```bash

               [1,2,3,4,5,6]         [1,2,None,4,5,6]

                     1                    1
                    / \                  / 
                   2   3                2  
                  /\   /               / \
                 4  5 6               4   5    
                                     /
                                    6
